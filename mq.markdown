1. What are Message Queues? 

Message queues are software-engineering components. In a system utilizing message queues, messages are queued up in sequential order. These messages are communicated between applications. An example of a message could relate to triggering a process to start by a receiving application. The content of the message could be a plain message, information about a task that has completed or one that is about to start. This is represented in a byte array with some headers included.
